Every blog starts with a "Hello World!" right?

I don't intend to write lengthy posts or even post regularly. I might as well be using {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.twitter_username label='Twitter' %} for the type of post I have in mind, but I like the idea of having my posts under {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username label='source control' %} and the possibility of including code snippets when necessary.

I'm particularly excited about a series of posts called _What's New?_, in
which I'll share the new technologies, languages, or tools I constantly
discover.
