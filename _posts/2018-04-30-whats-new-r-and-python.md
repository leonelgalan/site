Epifany recently hired a couple of Data Scientists. I decided to learn enough R
and Python to be dangerous. I've always wanted to say that. The truth is, I'm
getting familiar with the two ecosystems to deploy solutions when needed.

## R
### Learning Resources

- [DataCamp](Learn Data Science Online): _Learn Data Science Online_
- [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/): _Become a Data Scientist_

I tried DataCamp for a a couple of hours. I thought it was great and it taught
me fundamentals that allowed me to further explore R, but (there is always a
but), I felt it moved too slow for developers trying to learn R.

### R Packages

- [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/): _An R package that converts your
existing R code to a web API using a handful of special one-line comments_.
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/): _Shiny is an R package that makes it easy
to build interactive web apps straight from R._
- [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): _The tidyverse is an opinionated
collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an
underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures._ They had me at
_opinionated_, coming from a strong Rails background I want someone to take lead
and show us a way to do things, if we like it we use it, if not we keep looking.
- [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): _This R package makes it
easy to integrate and control Leaflet maps in R_

## Other

- [R Style Guide](http://jef.works/R-style-guide/) by the talented
[Jean Fan](http://jef.works/).
- [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen): _Hydrogen is an interactive
coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and other Jupyter
kernels._ I've been a fan of "notebooks" (the [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
kind), but the closest I had so far was
[RunKit](https://runkit.com/leonelgalan/). Now I can run R, Python and
JavaScript, as notebooks within Atom (See screenshot below). The result of each
cell is shown within the code.

## Python

I've done small bits of Python and even played with
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) before, but only now, after playing with R
I get it. I'm currently replicating all my R experiments in Python, by the end
of it I expect to choose one and expand my Data Science skills further.
