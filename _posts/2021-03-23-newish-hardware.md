After 10+ years of using Apple's Magic Keyboard and Mouse, don't judge, I switched! I bought Logitech's [_MX Keys Wireless Illuminated Keyboard_](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.html) and [_MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse with Hyper-fast Scroll_](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.html).

Often, I work with Windows and Mac, side-by-side, and [Logitech Flow](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options/page/flow-multi-device-control) makes it so much easier.

For most of my development I'm using Ubuntu, installed through WSL. I needed the contents of a file inside Ubuntu in my Mac: I read the file contents and sent that to the Windows Clipboard:

```sh
cat secrets.txt | clip.exe
```

I moved my mouse into my Mac and because my clipboard is shared across computers I was able to paste the contents inside the _secrets.txt_ on my Mac. That single operation used all three operating systems at once!

## Other Pros

* Being able to charge the mouse while in use
* The mouse ergonomics are much better than the Magic Mouse
* The scroll wheels are truly amazing and I have a middle click button
* Quickly toggle between 3 devices (even without using Flow)
* Having a numpad
* No switches to toggle when changing between Windows/Mac
* USB Type C, no more lighting cables
