Software Developer. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and

I started dabbling into web development since the
[GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) days; before
frameworks were cool and when monolithic PHP websites where the norm. Later I
studied Computer Science at
[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala](http://uvg.edu.gt/) and
[North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).

I've been working with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript for the last
{{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2011 }} years. While doing consulting, I
lead a team of talented developers that built dozens of web and mobile Apps for
clients of all sizes. Nowadays, I get to focus on our own products, be more
involved with every aspect, and explore newer trends and technologies.

I contribute to open source whenever I can, you can find a list of my
contributions [here](/os).
